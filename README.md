# Odd Marble Out

* You are given a balancing scale and 12 marbles that look exactly alike.
However, one of the marbles is eith lighter or heavier than the other 11.
* Using the balancing scale no more than 3 times, you need to determine if which marble is different and if it is lighter or heavier than the other one.

## How to solve
Implement the solve functin in solver.py and demonstrate that you can find
the correct marble without cheating by writing tests and getting those test to pass.

The `solve` function should return a list, where the first value is the index of the marble the second value is `True` if the marble is heavier and `False` if the marble is lighter.
